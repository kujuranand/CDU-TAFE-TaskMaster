Press [E] to talk to Glenn.

G'day mate! How're ya going?

Your first task is to find and put on all the PPE. Come back and report once you're suited up.

Well done! You're fully equipped to tackle any hazards on the job.

Your second task is to collect your work permits for the workshop.

You'll find the work permits in the mezzanine office. Bring them back here when you're ready.

Great job! You're now permitted to work in the workshop.

Your third task is to identify 6 safety hazards in the workshop. Once you've got them, report back.

Fantastic work, mate! You've completed all the tasks.

You're all set! Please head to the exit door to finish the assessment. Cheers!



G'day, mate! How ya goin'? You look as lost as a kangaroo in a supermarket.

Righto, your first job's a ripper—track down all the PPE gear and chuck 'em on. Don’t want ya copping a knock on the noggin. Come back once you're all dolled up.

Struth! Look at ya, mate! All suited up like you're ready to wrestle a croc. Bloody good job!

Next up, grab your work permits for the workshop. No skivin’ off now.

You’ll find the permits up in the mezzanine office. Bring ‘em back once you’ve wrangled ‘em. And no, there's no shortcuts, ya cheeky bugger!

By the way, I dunno where me bloody coffee's gone. Reckon it’s done a runner! Keep an eye out, will ya, mate? Can’t be startin’ the day without me caffeine fix!

You beauty! Now that you’ve got your permits, you're officially licensed to cause a ruckus in the workshop.

Alright, your next gig—spot 6 safety hazards around here. If you miss any, I’ll start throwin’ things!

Bonza work, mate! You’ve got all the hazards. Reckon you’re sharper than a dunny spider.

Righto, you're all sorted! Now trot off to the exit door and wrap up the assessment. Cheers, legend!


Ah, you found Glenn's coffee! You're a real lifesaver—he can't function without it! 

You've scored some extra points for this one!
